# EventHorizon 2

A rewrite of EventHorizon Continued for World of Warcraft 11.0 and beyond

## Why rewrite? Why don't continue under EventHorizon name?

This addon accumulated a lot of legacy over the years. Spaghetti code, huge files without any structure (the main file has 4600 lines of code!) - it is basically unmaintainable.

As a person who enjoys this addon so much that I cannot play WoW without it, I was left with a hard decision - either rewrite it from scratch, or abandon it and let it rot. I cannot "just patch it for TWW" and retain my sanity at the same time (which would be on brand with the expansion theme, but...) - so I decided to make it anew.

What will this give us? It will give up opportunities to improve this addon - even as radical as (gasp!) having a GUI configuration. That's right, in the (far) future there might be no need for a casual user to tinker with Lua code in the config files!

So, good luck to me. It will be long, hard, and I don't give any promises on when it will end. But it will be done. Eventually.
